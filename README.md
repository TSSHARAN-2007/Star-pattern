# ðŸ”º Triangular Star Matrix

This is a simple Python program that prints a **right-aligned triangular pattern** using stars (`*`). It's a classic beginner project for practicing loops and formatting in Python.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Program Does

- Asks the user to enter a number (`n`)
- Prints `n` rows of stars aligned to the right
- Rejects inputs of `n <= 1` with a friendly message

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

- Calculates how many spaces are needed on each line
- Uses string multiplication (`" " * spaces` and `"*" * stars`)
- Combines spaces and stars in each row using a `for` loop

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run this in the terminal:

```bash
python triangular_star_matrix.py
